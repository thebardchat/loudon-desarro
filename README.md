> **50,000 SF multi-sport athletic complex** honoring two wrestling legends.
> Filling the gap between Birmingham and Nashville. Hazel Green, Alabama.

## The Problem

Wrestling is booming in **Birmingham**. It's massive in **Nashville**. But between those two cities — 190 miles of nothing. No dedicated multi-sport training complex serves North Alabama's growing youth athletics corridor.

Kids drive hours or they don't go at all.

**That's the gap. This is the fix.**

## The Facility

| Feature | Spec |
|---------|------|
| **Total Footprint** | 50,000 SF (200' x 250' Quonset Hangar) |
| **Wrestling Arena** | 3x NCAA regulation 42'x42' competition mats |
| **PLEX FLEX™ System** | 2,600 retractable concrete beam seats (inside/outside/split) |
| **Indoor Turf** | 40-yard marked field — football, soccer, agility |
| **Strength & Conditioning** | Power racks, Olympic platforms, cable machines |
| **Glass Garage Doors** | Full east wall opens to outdoor training field |
| **Amenities** | Concessions, merch, locker rooms, offices, food truck parking |

### PLEX FLEX™ — The Innovation

16 rows of retractable concrete beams that deploy 2,600 seats **through the wall**. Full indoor arena. Full outdoor stadium. Or split between both. Nothing like it exists.

## The Market Opportunity

```
Birmingham ←── 95 mi ──→ ★ HAZEL GREEN ←── 95 mi ──→ Nashville
(Established)              (On the State Line)         (Massive Market)
```

- **50+ schools** in draw radius (Madison County, Limestone County, southern Tennessee)
- **3-state draw** — Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia athletes within 2-hour drive
- **Year-round revenue** — tournaments, camps, S&C memberships, turf rentals, outdoor events
- **Zero competition** — no dedicated facility exists in this corridor

## Named for Legends

### Coach Loudon — *In Memory*
Head wrestling coach at Hazel Green High School. Lost to a heart attack at the start of this season. Poured everything into his wrestlers — not just technique, but character. His name goes on the front door.

### Coach DeSarro — *In Honor*
Retired head coach at Grissom High School. One of the winningest wrestling coaches in Alabama history. Built men for decades. Coached Coach Loudon. Coached me. Without him, none of us would be here.
